# Exploratory Data Analysis on Car Data

# Introduction
This project is focused on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a car dataset to uncover hidden patterns and insights. The dataset consists of 202 observations and 26 variables, each providing valuable information about different aspects of cars.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following variables:

Symboling: Numerical representation of car safety.
Normalized Losses: Losses due to ignition.
Make: Manufacturer's name.
Fuel Type: Type of fuel the car runs on (Gas or Diesel).
Aspiration: Type of engine aspiration (Std or Turbo).
Num of Doors: Number of doors in the car.
Body Type: Style of the car (sedan, hatchback, wagon, etc.).
Drive Wheel: Which wheel powers the car.
Engine Location: Location of the car's engine.
Wheel Base: Size of the wheel base.
Dimensions: Length, width, height, and curb weight of the car.
Engine Specifications: Bore, stroke, engine size, compression ratio, and peak RPM.
Engine Type: Type of engine.
Number of Cylinders: The count of cylinders in the car's engine.
Fuel System: The system that delivers fuel to the engine (e.g., MPFI).
Miles Per Gallon: City and highway miles per gallon (mpg) that the car provides.
Price: The price of the car.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was performed to uncover key insights that can assist car owners in making informed decisions. This involved:

Visualizations: Creating plots and charts to understand distributions, relationships, and trends.
Descriptive Statistics: Analyzing mean, median, standard deviation, and other summary statistics.
Correlation Analysis: Identifying relationships between variables.
Feature Importance: Determining features that significantly influence the car's price.

# Key Findings
Through EDA, several impactful findings were revealed:

Fuel Efficiency Impact: Higher mpg tends to result in a higher price.
Car Body Type: Certain body types have higher prices.
Engine Specifications: Some engine specifications influence the price significantly.
Car Make: Specific manufacturers offer cars at varying price ranges.
Drive Wheel and Cylinder Count: These features also play a role in determining the car's price.
